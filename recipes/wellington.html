    <h2>Chef John's Beef Wellington Recipe</h2>
    <p>Already tried Gordon Ramsay's famous Beef Wellington recipe?
        If you've already attempted the notorious chef's interpretaion of this
        classic Christmas dish, you might want to turn your eyes toward the underrated
        Wellington recipe of one of the oldest cooking YouTube channels. Though not
        as glamorous as the British culinary sensation, chef John's humble, sing-songy
        approach to culinary arts and presentation might just leave you pleasntly surprised.</p>
    <p>I mean, who could say no to your favorite uncle, who always smuggled your
        favorite candy, performed bad magic tricks, and made you laugh until you cried?
        So, if you find the hot-headed, oft-swearing, blond-headed Brit somewhat off putting,
        then chef John's jolly demeanor just might be what you need this holiday season.
        So let's jump right in.
