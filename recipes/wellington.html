            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook mushrooms, shallots, salt, and spices in butter until browned and caramelized. Let cool.
                </li>
                <li>             
                    Mix mushroom mixture with pate until well combined. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add pate to cooled mushroom mixture; toss and mash with
                    a spoon until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season filets with salt and pepper. Sear in butter until browned. Transfer to a plate and refrigerate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll out puff pastry and cut into squares. Place a portion of the mushroom mixture on each square.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread mustard on one side of each filet. Place mustard-side down on the mushroom mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold the pastry around the filet to seal, leaving the ends open. Place on a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in a preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes. Flip and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes until cooked through and crispy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer the Wellington to the freezer for 15 minutes.

                <li>
                    Prepare a baking sheet with aluminum foil and parchment paper. Beat an egg with water and brush the Wellingtons with the egg wash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown and puffed, and the filets are cooked through, about 23-25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the Wellingtons in half and trim the ends.

                <li>
                    Place each pastry base on a plate and top with two filet halves, cut side up. Serve immediately.
